# CHESS State-Based Analysis

This software is part of **PolarSys CHESS**, an open source methodology and tool for the development of high-integrity embedded systems.
Formerly the "CHESS Framework", it is an integrated collection of Eclipse plugins developed within different research projects, in particular the [CHESS](http://chess-project.org/) and [CONCERTO](http://concerto-project.eu/) projects.

## PolarSys CHESS

[PolarSys](http://polarsys.org/) is an Eclipse Working Group focusing on the creation and support of open source tools for the development of embedded systems.
Most of the original CHESS Framework has been released as open source within the PolarSys umbrella, constituting the *PolarSys CHESS Eclipse Project*.
Further information can be found on the [Official Website](http://polarsys.org/chess/) and on the [Eclipse Project Page](https://www.polarsys.org/projects/polarsys.chess/).

## Usage

This plugin performs **Quantitative Dependability Analysis** using a variant of the **Stochastic Petri Nets** formalism. It is _not_ a standalone program, but requires the full installation of [PolarSys CHESS](http://polarsys.org/chess/).

Usage instructions are available [in the wiki](https://github.com/montex/CHESS-SBA/wiki). Further information can be found in the following documents, as well as in the [scientific publications](#publications) related to this plugin.
